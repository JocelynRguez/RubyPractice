DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean

by setting up a rake task which runs
